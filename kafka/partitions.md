You're asking important questions about partition configuration and scaling in kafkajs. Let's address them:

**How are partitions configured for consumers in kafkajs?**

In kafkajs (and Kafka in general), consumers don't directly configure partitions.  Consumers *subscribe* to topics. Kafka *assigns* partitions to consumers within a consumer group.  The assignment is handled by Kafka based on the consumer group's configuration and the number of partitions in the topic.  You influence this process through the `groupId` and by starting multiple consumer instances.

* **`groupId`:**  As we've discussed, the `groupId` is crucial.  Consumers with the same `groupId` form a consumer group, and Kafka distributes partitions among them.
* **Number of Consumer Instances:**  The number of consumer instances you start with the same `groupId` affects how the partitions are distributed.  Kafka aims to distribute partitions evenly among the active consumers in the group.

**Where is it configured how many partitions a topic contains?**

The number of partitions for a topic is configured when the topic is *created*.  This is typically done through the Kafka command-line tools (`kafka-topics.sh`) or programmatically using a Kafka admin client.  You specify the number of partitions when you create the topic.  This configuration is stored within Kafka's metadata.

**Example (using `kafka-topics.sh`):**

```bash
kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic --partitions 4 --replication-factor 3 --zookeeper <zookeeper_connect_string>
```

This command creates a topic named `my-topic` with 4 partitions and a replication factor of 3.  The replication factor determines how many copies of each partition are stored for fault tolerance.

**What is the scaling involved with partitions? Are they auto-scalable?**

* **Scaling Consumers:** The primary way to scale consumption in Kafka is to add more consumers to a consumer group (i.e., start more consumer instances with the same `groupId`).  Kafka will rebalance the partition assignments among the active consumers.  This is how you achieve horizontal scaling for message processing.

* **Scaling Partitions (Adding Partitions):**  You *can* increase the number of partitions for an existing topic using the `kafka-topics.sh` command with the `--alter` option.  This allows you to increase the parallelism of your topic if you anticipate higher message volumes.

* **Auto-Scaling Partitions:** Kafka *does not* automatically scale the number of partitions for a topic.  You need to manually increase the number of partitions using the command-line tools or an admin client. There are some third-party tools and operators for Kubernetes that can help automate this but it's not a native feature.

**Important Considerations for Partition Scaling**

* **Increasing Partitions:** While increasing partitions is relatively straightforward, it's essential to consider the implications for existing consumers.  Kafka will rebalance partitions, which can cause temporary disruptions in message processing.
* **Decreasing Partitions:** Decreasing the number of partitions is more complex and generally not recommended.  It can lead to data loss if not handled carefully.
* **Over-Partitioning:** Having too many partitions can lead to performance overhead.  It's important to choose an appropriate number of partitions based on your message volume, consumer count, and hardware resources. A general rule of thumb is to have more partitions than consumers, allowing for future scaling.

**In summary:**

* Consumers are scaled by adding more instances to a consumer group (same `groupId`).
* The number of partitions is configured when the topic is created.
* Partitions are not auto-scalable in core Kafka. You must manually add partitions.
* Scaling partitions should be done cautiously and with an understanding of the implications.

You're asking about the conditions required for a Kafka consumer to start consuming messages.  Here's the breakdown:

**Prerequisites for a Consumer to Start Consuming:**

1. **Topic Existence:** The topic the consumer is subscribing to *must* exist.  If the topic doesn't exist, the consumer will typically encounter an error and fail to start or will continuously retry the connection until the topic exists.

2. **Consumer Group and `groupId`:** The consumer must be part of a consumer group, meaning it must have a `groupId` configured.  This `groupId` is how Kafka tracks the consumer's progress and manages partition assignments.

3. **Connection to Kafka Brokers:** The consumer must be able to establish a connection to the Kafka brokers.  This involves providing the correct broker addresses and any necessary authentication details.

4. **Subscription to Topic(s):** The consumer must explicitly subscribe to the topic(s) it wants to consume from.  This tells Kafka which topics the consumer is interested in.

5. **Partitions Assigned (Automatic):** Kafka automatically assigns partitions to consumers within a group.  You don't manually configure which partitions a consumer gets.  The assignment happens when the consumer connects and subscribes.

**Will a consumer automatically start consuming?**

Yes, *once all the prerequisites are met*, a consumer will automatically start consuming messages from the assigned partitions.  You do *not* need to produce a "dummy" message to activate the consumer group or start consumption.

**What happens if there are no messages in the partition when the consumer starts?**

The consumer's behavior in this scenario depends on the `auto.offset.reset` configuration (or `fromBeginning` in kafkajs):

* **`auto.offset.reset = latest` (or `fromBeginning: false` in kafkajs):** This is the default.  If there are no messages in the partition when the consumer starts, the consumer will start consuming *only new messages* that are produced *after* it connects.  It will not go back and read any previous messages.

* **`auto.offset.reset = earliest` (or `fromBeginning: true` in kafkajs):** If there are no messages, or if the consumer has never consumed from this partition before, the consumer will start consuming from the *earliest offset* available in the partition.  This means it will read all messages from the beginning of the partition's history.

**In short:** You don't need a dummy message. The consumer will start consuming automatically once it's connected, subscribed, and partitions have been assigned, and it will behave as per the `auto.offset.reset` configuration.

**Example (kafkajs):**

```javascript
// ... Kafka client and consumer setup ...

await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'my-topic', fromBeginning: true }); // Or fromBeginning: false

await consumer.run({
  eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
    // Process the message
  },
});

// The consumer will start consuming as soon as it connects and the topic exists, 
// regardless of whether there are messages present initially.
```

If `fromBeginning` is `true`, it will start from the beginning of the partition, or if there are no messages it will wait for new messages. If `fromBeginning` is `false`, it will wait for new messages.  No dummy message is required.
