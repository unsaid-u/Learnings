worker:
  base-url: ${INCREFFEXT_INTERNL_SVC}

Example
Suppose you have two services in your Kubernetes cluster:

Service A: Provides some API endpoints.
Service B: Needs to call an API provided by Service A.
Instead of Service B making an external API call (which might look like https://api.example.com/some-endpoint), Service B will use the internal service URL provided by Kubernetes.

Internal SVC URL
Service Name: When Service A is deployed, Kubernetes assigns it a service name, for example, service-a.
Namespace: If Service A is in a specific namespace, say default, the full DNS name for Service A will be service-a.default.svc.cluster.local.
Port: Kubernetes will expose Service A on a specific port, say 8080.
So, the internal URL to call Service A from Service B might look like:

bash
Copy code
http://service-a.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/some-endpoint
Example in Your Context
Here is how you might use this in a script or application code:

sh
Copy code
# Environment variable for the internal service URL
export INCREFFEXT_INTERNL_SVC="http://service-a.default.svc.cluster.local:8080"

# Use this URL to make an API call from within the pod
curl "${INCREFFEXT_INTERNL_SVC}/some-endpoint"
In this example, the application or script running in Service B uses the internal service URL (INCREFFEXT_INTERNL_SVC) to call the API endpoint /some-endpoint provided by Service A.

Benefits
Performance: Reduced latency and faster response times.
Security: Keeps internal communication within the cluster, reducing exposure to potential external threats.
Reliability: Internal DNS and service discovery ensure that even if the underlying pod IPs change, the service name remains consistent and reachable.
Using internal SVC URLs for inter-service communication within a Kubernetes cluster leverages Kubernetes' powerful service discovery and DNS resolution features to create a more efficient, secure, and reliable microservices architecture.
