Under the hood, every incoming HTTP request in Node.js is represented by an `http.IncomingMessage` object (in Express, it’s the `req` object), which is itself a **readable stream** of raw `Buffer` chunks. How much of that stream ends up in memory depends entirely on what you do with it:

---

## 1. Default (no parser)

If you never call any body-parsing middleware or manually subscribe to the stream, **nothing** is buffered in your JavaScript heap. The data sits in the OS socket buffers until you read it (via `req.on('data')` or `req.pipe(...)`), and once you process each chunk, it’s eligible for GC (or backpressured if you pause the stream).

```js
// No multer, no body-parser
http.createServer((req, res) => {
  req.on('data', chunk => {
    // chunk is a Buffer (e.g. ~16–64 KB)
    // if you DON'T store it, it's freed once you return from this callback
  });
  req.on('end', () => {
    res.end('Done\n');
  });
});
```

* **Memory usage**: only one or two chunks (\~tens of KB) at a time, plus whatever your processing code holds on to.

---

## 2. Manual buffering

If you decide to accumulate the whole body yourself—common in quick demos or naive parsers—you’ll do something like:

```js
const chunks = [];
req.on('data', chunk => chunks.push(chunk));
req.on('end', () => {
  const fullBody = Buffer.concat(chunks);
  // fullBody is now the entire request in RAM
});
```

* **Memory usage**: roughly `sum of all chunk sizes` = the full request size.
* If you get a 5 MB upload and you buffer it this way, you’ll hold \~5 MB in RAM (plus overhead).

---

## 3. Body-parsing middleware (JSON, urlencoded)

Express’s built-in `express.json()` or `express.urlencoded()` behave like “manual buffering + parse” under the hood:

* They read every chunk into an internal array.
* On `end`, they do `Buffer.concat` to build the full body.
* Then they parse (`JSON.parse` or `qs.parse`) and attach it to `req.body`.

**So** for a 1 MB JSON payload, they’ll buffer \~1 MB in RAM before you ever see `req.body`.

---

## 4. Multipart/form-data without Multer

There is **no** built-in multipart parser in Node or Express. If you tried to read a `multipart/form-data` upload without Multer (or Busboy/etc.), you’d have to:

1. Read all chunks from the stream.
2. Concatenate them (i.e. buffer the entire request).
3. Manually parse boundaries, headers, and file–field data out of that big `Buffer`.

Again, that means the **entire** upload lives in RAM at once.

---

## 5. Why this matters for concurrency

Every concurrent request spins up its own `req` stream. If each one is:

* **Streaming** (piping chunks off to disk or another service), your RAM stays bounded to a few chunks per request—so even 100 simultaneous 5 MB uploads might only use \~100×64 KB = 6.4 MB of RAM, plus a bit of overhead.
* **Buffering fully** (via body-parser or manual concat), your RAM usage is roughly `#requests × requestSize`. Ten simultaneous 5 MB uploads = \~50 MB of RAM!

---

## TL;DR and Recommendation

* **Without Multer**: Node gives you a stream. If you buffer the whole thing (manually or via a generic body-parser), you’ll load the entire request into RAM.
* **With a streaming parser** (Multer’s diskStorage, Busboy, etc.): you consume each chunk and immediately write it out (to disk, to another API), so your RAM footprint is just those in-flight chunks (tens of KB), even for multi-megabyte files.

For scalable uploads—especially large images and high concurrency—**always treat `req` as a stream** and either pipe it directly where it needs to go or use a streaming multipart parser (like Multer’s disk mode) so you never buffer the entire payload in memory.

Switching from Multer’s **memory** storage to **disk** storage does introduce a bit more I/O work—but it doesn’t mean your entire 5 MB image is first loaded into RAM and then written out. Here’s what happens under the hood, and how it affects latency and memory:

---
___

Q . if have an API that accepts the image using a multer, then makes another API call and simply passes that image to it, 
currently the multer is configured to have the file stored in memory, instead of disk. 
images can be max of 5mbs
If i switch to disk storage for multer, will it add any latency, 
what memory changes will be done under the hood, 
i think the image buffer will be stored direclty from request to disk, or will it come to memory first then to disk , then referred by the multer objet ?? 

## 1. What DiskStorage Actually Does

* **Chunked streaming**
  Multer (via Busboy) parses the incoming multipart stream in small chunks (by default \~64 KB each). For **diskStorage**, each chunk is immediately written to a `fs.WriteStream` pointed at your uploads folder.

* **No full-file buffering**
  You **don’t** get one giant 5 MB Buffer in memory. Instead, only each chunk lives in RAM transiently while it’s being written out, then is garbage-collected once flushed.

* **File metadata**
  After completion, Multer populates `req.file` with something like:

  ```js
  {
    fieldname: 'avatar',
    originalname: 'photo.jpg',
    encoding: '7bit',
    mimetype: 'image/jpeg',
    destination: './uploads',
    filename: '1624382938573-photo.jpg',
    path: 'uploads/1624382938573-photo.jpg',
    size: 3456789
  }
  ```

## 2. Latency Impact

| Step                   | MemoryStorage                                                 | DiskStorage                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Inbound parsing**    | Buffer all chunks into a single Buffer in RAM as they arrive. | Write each chunk directly to disk as it arrives. |
| **Overhead per chunk** | Allocate and copy into JS Buffer.                             | Allocate JS Buffer + syscall to write to disk.   |
| **End result**         | Whole file already in RAM (`req.file.buffer`).                | Whole file on disk (`req.file.path`).            |

* **Extra syscall cost**
  Each chunk write does a small syscall (`write(2)`), which adds maybe **0.1–1 ms per chunk** on a modern SSD. For a 5 MB file at 64 KB chunks → \~80 writes → \~10–80 ms extra overhead.

* **Relative to network/API call**
  If you immediately stream or upload that file to another service, you’ll likely spend **hundreds of ms** (or more) over the network—so the additional 10–80 ms disk write is usually negligible.

---

## 3. Memory Usage

* **MemoryStorage**

  * One Buffer of up to 5 MB lives in RAM until you explicitly dispose of it.
  * Peak RAM used ≈ `file.size` + framework overhead.

* **DiskStorage**

  * Only one chunk Buffer (64 KB) plus maybe a couple in flight—so **\~100–200 KB** of RAM at most, regardless of file size.
  * The rest lives on disk (your uploads folder).

---

## 4. How to Forward the File to Another API

### A. From MemoryStorage

```js
// You already have `req.file.buffer` in RAM
await axios.post('https://api.example.com/ingest', req.file.buffer, {
  headers: { 'Content-Type': req.file.mimetype }
});
```

### B. From DiskStorage (streaming, no big Buffer)

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const stream = fs.createReadStream(req.file.path);

await axios({
  method: 'post',
  url: 'https://api.example.com/ingest',
  data: stream,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': req.file.mimetype,
    // Important for node: let axios set Content-Length or use Transfer-Encoding: chunked
  }
});
```

* **Benefit**: you never load the whole file back into RAM—just a small stream buffer as it’s being read.

---

## 5. Summary

1. **DiskStorage** does **add** a small latency (disk-write syscalls) versus pure in-RAM storage—but it **dramatically** reduces your RAM footprint (from 5 MB → \~100 KB).
2. Multer writes each chunk directly to disk; it does **not** buffer the entire file in memory first.
3. When forwarding to another API, you can stream the file off disk without re-buffering it in full, preserving your low-memory advantage.

In most production systems—especially when files can be large or your server handles many uploads in parallel—**diskStorage with streaming** is the more scalable choice, trading a few tens of ms of extra I/O for much lower and predictable RAM usage.
