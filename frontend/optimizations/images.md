Excellent performance-focused question! Let's break this down step-by-step:

---

## üß† **When Does the Browser Load Images?**

### ‚úÖ **By Default:**

* When the browser parses an `<img>` tag with a `src` attribute, it **immediately starts requesting the image**.
* This happens **during DOM construction**, not after it's fully built.

**Example:**

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Example" />
```

As soon as the parser sees this line, it triggers an image request in parallel with DOM construction.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How This Fits with Incremental DOM Building**

* The browser parses HTML top-down.
* As it encounters `<img>` tags, it queues image requests.
* **Render blocking is minimal** unless:

  * The image is huge and used in the first paint (e.g. a hero banner).
  * The image is `<img srcset>` with complex selection logic.

---

## üöÄ **Image Optimization Techniques**

Here‚Äôs what you should do to improve performance:

---

### 1. **Lazy Loading**

Defer image loading until they're in (or near) the viewport.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Lazy image" />
```

* Native in modern browsers.
* Huge impact for long pages with many images.

---

### 2. **Responsive Images**

Use `srcset` and `sizes` so that browsers pick the best image size for the current screen:

```html
<img
  src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 480w, medium.jpg 768w, large.jpg 1200w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px, 800px"
  alt="Responsive"
/>
```

‚úÖ Saves bandwidth for mobile users
‚úÖ Improves perceived speed

---

### 3. **Use Modern Image Formats**

* **WebP** and **AVIF** offer much better compression than JPEG/PNG.
* Fallback to older formats if needed.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Optimized" />
</picture>
```

---

### 4. **Image Compression**

* Use tools like [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app), TinyPNG, or image processing pipelines.
* Resize and compress images **before deployment**.

---

### 5. **Avoid Layout Shift (CLS)**

Define width and height to prevent content jumps when images load:

```html
<img src="img.jpg" alt="Cat" width="400" height="300" />
```

Helps **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** score in Core Web Vitals.

---

### 6. **Use CDNs for Image Delivery**

A CDN like Cloudflare, ImageKit, or Cloudinary can:

* Resize on the fly
* Compress on the fly
* Serve from edge locations

---

### 7. **Preload Critical Images**

For hero images, use `<link rel="preload">` in `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="hero.jpg" />
```

## üìù Summary

| Optimization       | Benefit                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `loading="lazy"`   | Load only when needed             |
| `srcset` + `sizes` | Responsive, size-aware loading    |
| Modern formats     | Faster load, smaller files        |
| Compression        | Bandwidth and speed win           |
| Preload key images | Faster First Contentful Paint     |
| Set `width/height` | Prevent layout shifts (CLS)       |
| CDN                | Faster delivery, smart transforms |

-> use of svgs for small icons, since they donot require new request
