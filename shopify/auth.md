You're on the right track with your understanding of Shopify's authentication and tokens. Let's clarify a few points and then address your Postman testing question.

**Key Concepts and Corrections:**

* **Access Tokens:** You're correct that these are used for making requests to the Shopify Admin API.  They are *not* stored directly in storage during installation.  Instead, during the OAuth process, Shopify *issues* an access token.  Your app should securely store this token.  This is crucial.  Never expose access tokens in client-side code.  They are used server-side in your Node.js app.
* **Session Tokens:** These are indeed used for authenticating requests to *your* Node.js app's routes protected by `shopify.validateAuthenticatedSession()`.  They're tied to the Shopify session and are managed by the Shopify app framework.  They are *not* directly issued by Shopify in the same way access tokens are.  Instead, they are derived from the session information.
* **OAuth:**  The process of getting an access token involves OAuth.  This is a standard authorization framework.  Your app redirects the merchant to Shopify to authorize the app's requested permissions.  Upon approval, Shopify redirects back to your app with a code.  Your app then uses this code to request the actual access token.
* **Token Storage:**  You're right that access tokens need to be stored securely.  Common approaches include environment variables (for development), or a database (for production).  Never hardcode them.
* **Expiry:**
    * **Access Tokens:**  Shopify access tokens generally do *not* expire. They are *permanent* unless they are revoked by the merchant or your app explicitly requests a new one (which is generally not necessary).  This is a key difference from many other APIs.
    * **Session Tokens:** Session tokens, being tied to the Shopify session, have a shorter lifespan.  They are typically valid for the duration of the merchant's session with your app.  The `shopify.validateAuthenticatedSession()` middleware handles the validation and renewal of these tokens behind the scenes.  You generally don't need to manage their expiry directly.

**Testing with Postman:**

You can't directly use the access token in Postman to test routes protected by `shopify.validateAuthenticatedSession()`.  This is because those routes require a valid *session token*, which is handled by the Shopify app framework and not directly exposed.

Here's the correct approach for testing these routes with Postman:

1. **Development Store:**  You *must* be using a development store for testing.  Never test with a production store.
2. **App Installation:** Install your Shopify app on your development store. This will establish the initial session.
3. **Ngrok (or similar):**  You'll need a tool like Ngrok to expose your local development server to the internet.  Shopify needs to be able to redirect back to your app after authentication.
4. **Shopify App URL:** In your Shopify app settings, ensure the "Allowed redirection URLs" are correctly configured to point to your Ngrok URL (e.g., `https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io/callback`). The `/callback` route is crucial; it's where Shopify redirects after authentication.
5. **Initiate OAuth Flow:** In Postman, open a new request.  The URL will be your Ngrok URL combined with the route that initiates the OAuth flow (this might be something like `https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io/auth`).  This will redirect you to the Shopify authorization page.
6. **Authorize:**  Complete the authorization process in your browser.  Shopify will redirect back to your `/callback` route.
7. **Session Cookie:**  Crucially, after successful authentication, your app (server-side) will set a *cookie* in the browser.  This cookie contains the session information (which is used to generate the session token).
8. **Postman Cookie Jar:** In Postman, you need to use a "Cookie Jar."  Enable it in Postman's settings.  Postman will then store the cookie received from your app during the OAuth flow.
9. **Test Protected Routes:** Now, when you make requests to your protected routes (e.g., `https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io/api/*`), Postman will automatically include the cookie (and therefore the session information) in the request headers.  `shopify.validateAuthenticatedSession()` will then be able to validate the session and allow the request.

**In summary:** You don't directly send a session token.  The session token is derived from the session information stored in a cookie.  Postman needs to store and send this cookie for your protected routes to work.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Security:**  Never expose your access token or any sensitive information in client-side code.
* **Testing:**  Thoroughly test your authentication flow and API routes.
* **Shopify App Framework:**  Leverage the Shopify app framework's built-in functions for handling sessions and authentication.  Don't try to reinvent the wheel.

This detailed explanation should help you get your Postman testing working correctly.  If you have further questions, feel free to ask!
