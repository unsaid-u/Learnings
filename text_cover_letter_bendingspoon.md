**Hiring Manager**
Bending Spoons

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm writing to express my interest in the Python Backend Engineer role at Bending Spoons. With a strong foundation in building scalable, production-grade backend systems, I’ve led and contributed to several projects that balance performance, reliability, and business impact.

At **GlamAR (Pixel Bin)**, I was part of the team building backend services for the AR and virtual try-on platform. My responsibilities included designing and implementing RESTful APIs, creating efficient database schemas, and building a Kafka-queued Bulk Upload feature to support high-volume product creation. I also implemented an API layer that interfaced with ML models for data-driven workflows, and delivered the GlamAR browser extension end-to-end, owning everything from service architecture to deployment. For monitoring and observability, I integrated New Relic and Sentry into the system. In addition, I wrote comprehensive unit tests that brought coverage to nearly 80%.

At **Fynd Platform**, I served as the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) for the Hogwarts microservice—an order-processing system ensuring real-time integration with third-party platforms. I led third-party integration efforts, designed schema changes that improved API latency, and handled multiple high-severity incidents as part of OnCall. I also played a key role in driving reliability by boosting test coverage and maintaining high-performance system components.

I also contributed to **Fynd’s supply-side platform**, where I designed workflows for various backend extensions, authored payload transformation scripts to ensure API compliance, and integrated contract testing using Specmatic. These efforts helped streamline integration pipelines and enabled a smooth migration to a newer version of the system.

What sets me apart is my focus on ownership, quality, and solving real-world backend challenges. I’m especially drawn to Bending Spoons' emphasis on building impactful digital products and pushing technical boundaries with elegance and efficiency. I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my backend expertise to a team that values deep engineering and product craftsmanship.

Thank you for considering my application. I’d love the opportunity to discuss how my experience and mindset can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,
**Utkarsh Jain**
