Proxy servers act as intermediaries between clients and servers, facilitating or controlling access to resources. 
There are two primary types of proxy servers: forward proxies and reverse proxies. 


- A forward proxy acts on behalf of the client, retrieving data from the internet and delivering it to the client. It hides the clientâ€™s IP address from the server.
     A forward proxy caches frequently accessed web pages. When a user requests a cached page, the proxy serves it without fetching it from the web server again.


- A reverse proxy acts on behalf of the server, intercepting requests from clients and forwarding them to the appropriate backend server. It hides the server's details from the client.

    - if the reverse proxy fails it can be a single point of failure
