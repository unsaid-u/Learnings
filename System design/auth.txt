Stateless Auth - JWT , OAuth
Stateful Auth - Sessions , cookies


Statful - sessions 
    - /login -> username, password ---> DB 
    - DB -> after matching -> return session_id 
            - save this session_id in redis (n-memory database)
    - session_id --> return to client -> will be used for api auth (x-session-id)
    - so this session_id has a an expiration time and is revoked after logout

    Pros:
        - short term Auth (ex: banking website)
        - controlled access 
    Cons:
        - memory dependent - difficult scalability
        - Server storage dependent
        - memory can be a point a failure


Stateless - JWT 
    - /login -> username, password ---> DB 
    - DB -> after match -> payload to be signed  -> sign(payload + secret_key) ---> signature
    - server returns a signed JOSN payload to client (aka access token) with a shorter expiration time
    - on request from client server verifies signature with its key 

    Pros:
        - memory efficient
        - longer session duration

    Cons:
        - difficult to manage 
        - less secure ?
