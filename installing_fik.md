installing fik 

- downloaded from github 
- copied to usrs/local/bin        -- i think this is the location for storing executables
- made it an execuatble   | chmod +x fik
- mac was not letting it execute - unable to find source, unable to scan for malwares 
    - in securrity settings - allow opening anyway    

- installed brew again - added to PATH
- brew intall kubectl
- installed glcoud cli (required for authentication)
- installed -  gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin

This solved my problems 
    -> fik installed with context fetch and kubectl commands working
