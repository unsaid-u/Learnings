I'd be glad to help you with using methods from another class in Java within the same package, without object creation (assuming the methods are static).

**Understanding Static Methods:**

- **Definition:** Static methods are methods that belong to the class itself, not to instances of the class. You can call them directly using the class name, without needing to create an object.
- **Purpose:** Static methods are often used for utility functions that don't rely on the state of a specific object, or for methods that operate on class-level data.

**Scenario:**

Let's consider two classes in the same package: `Calculator` and `MathHelper`:

```java
// Calculator.java
public class Calculator {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// MathHelper.java
public class MathHelper {
    public void calculateArea(int length, int breadth) {
        // This method requires object creation
        System.out.println("Area: " + (length * breadth));
    }
}
```

**Using a Static Method Directly:**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = Calculator.add(5, 3); // No object creation for static method
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `add` method in `Calculator` is static. You can call it using the class name `Calculator` followed by a dot (`.`) and the method name: `Calculator.add(5, 3)`. This works without creating an object of the `Calculator` class.

**Non-Static Methods Require Object Creation:**

The `calculateArea` method in `MathHelper` is not static. To call it, you need to create an object of the `MathHelper` class:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MathHelper helper = new MathHelper(); // Object creation required
        helper.calculateArea(10, 20);
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Static methods are accessible directly using the class name.
- Non-static methods require object creation for access.
- Choose static methods when the functionality doesn't depend on the state of a specific object.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Static methods can access other static members of the same class directly, without needing an object.
- Non-static methods can access static members using the class name or through an object of the class.
- When in doubt about whether to make a method static, consider its purpose and whether it needs to operate on object-specific data or class-level data.
