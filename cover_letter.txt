Hiring Manager
[Company Name]
[Company Address]

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm writing to express my interest in a [Fullstack Developer] role at [Company Name]. With hands-on experience building production-grade systems at scale, I’ve led and contributed to multiple projects—from building robust backend microservices to crafting intuitive frontend interfaces—all with a focus on performance, usability, and business impact.

At GlamAR (Pixel Bin), I worked fullstack on a complete revamp of the AR platform console. I developed the frontend in React, implemented performant REST APIs, and designed new database schemas. I also took full ownership of delivering the GlamAR browser extension—from initial design to deployment—and introduced observability with New Relic and Sentry. One highlight was building a Kafka-queued Bulk Upload feature that streamlined product creation.

At Fynd Platform, I served as the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) for the Hogwarts microservice, an order-processing system integrated with external platforms. I led the design of third-party integrations, optimized latency through schema changes, and resolved critical production incidents as part of OnCall. I also improved test coverage across services and contributed to system reliability.

Additionally, I worked on extensions for supply integrations, where I designed a new admin UI that improved user interaction by 30%, implemented payload transformation scripts, and played a key role in migrating legacy systems to v3—unlocking a new revenue stream for the company.

What sets me apart is my balance of technical depth and product sense. I focus not just on delivering code, but on building tools and systems that solve real problems. I'm excited by the opportunity to work with a team where I can continue learning, contribute meaningfully, and grow alongside the product.

Thank you for considering my application. I’d love the opportunity to discuss how my background could contribute to your team.

Sincerely,
Utkarsh Jain
