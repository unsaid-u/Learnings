Great idea! Categorizing the patterns helps you understand their purpose better. Here's how the 10 design patterns I listed fall into the main **GoF (Gang of Four)** categories:

---

## 🔨 **Creational Patterns**  
> *Deal with object creation mechanisms.*

1. **Singleton**  
2. **Factory Pattern**  
3. **Builder Pattern**

---

## 🔁 **Structural Patterns**  
> *Concerned with object composition and typically help make complex structures more manageable.*

4. **Adapter Pattern**  
5. **Decorator Pattern**  
6. **Proxy Pattern**

---

## 🔄 **Behavioral Patterns**  
> *Deal with communication between objects and responsibilities.*

7. **Strategy Pattern**  
8. **Observer Pattern**  
9. **Command Pattern**  
10. **Template Method**

---

These categories help guide *when* to use a pattern:

- **Creational:** When object creation is complex or needs control.
- **Structural:** When you want to simplify or decouple relationships.
- **Behavioral:** When you’re focused on how objects interact and behave.
