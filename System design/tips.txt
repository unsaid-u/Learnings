The typical system design question will start with a problem statement, a thing for you to design, and scale numbers to guide your design. 
I've seen interviewers skip this last part but it's crucial â€“ designing a system for 100 users is different than 1 billion.

I like to guide candidates into a 4 stage approach:

Design the data schema
Design the API
Design the data querying
Design the hosted architecture
