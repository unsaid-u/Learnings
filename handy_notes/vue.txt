-> computed properties
https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed.html

Instead of a computed property, we can define the same function as a method. For the end result, the two approaches are indeed exactly the same. 
However, the difference is that computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies. A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its reactive dependencies have changed. 
This means as long as author.books has not changed, multiple access to publishedBooksMessage will immediately return the previously computed result without having to run the getter function again.
