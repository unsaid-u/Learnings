a. Core Concepts
    Load Balancers (Types, L4/L7)

    Databases (SQL vs NoSQL, CAP theorem, scaling, replication)

    Caching (Redis, Memcached, cache strategies)

    Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)

    Consistency Patterns (Eventual, Strong, Read/Write Patterns)

    Partitioning, Sharding, Replication

    API Gateways, Rate Limiting

    CDN, Edge Caching

    Async Processing (worker pools, cron jobs)

    Data Modeling (Indexing, Denormalization, Joins, etc.)

    Monitoring & Alerting

b. Scalability & Reliability
    Horizontal vs Vertical scaling

    Consistent hashing

    Leader election, Heartbeats

    Backpressure, Circuit breakers

    Idempotency

c. Design Patterns
    Microservices vs Monolith

    Pub/Sub

    CQRS, Event Sourcing

d. Non-functional Requirements
    Security: Authentication/Authorization, OWASP basics

    Observability: Logging, Monitoring, Tracing
