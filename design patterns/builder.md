The code snippet `OrdersRequest.builder().` suggests that the `OrdersRequest` class uses the Builder pattern. This is a common design pattern used for constructing complex objects in a step-by-step manner. In Java, this is often facilitated using a static inner class called `Builder` within the main class.

### Builder Pattern Overview

The Builder pattern is used to create objects that require a lot of configuration. Instead of having a constructor with many parameters, the Builder pattern allows you to set each parameter individually and then build the object when you are ready.

### Example of a Class with Builder Pattern

Below is a simplified example of how a class using the Builder pattern might look:

```java
public class OrdersRequest {
    private final String orderId;
    private final String customerName;
    private final int quantity;
    private final double price;

    // Private constructor to enforce object creation via Builder
    private OrdersRequest(Builder builder) {
        this.orderId = builder.orderId;
        this.customerName = builder.customerName;
        this.quantity = builder.quantity;
        this.price = builder.price;
    }

    // Static nested Builder class
    public static class Builder {
        private String orderId;
        private String customerName;
        private int quantity;
        private double price;

        public Builder orderId(String orderId) {
            this.orderId = orderId;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder customerName(String customerName) {
            this.customerName = customerName;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder quantity(int quantity) {
            this.quantity = quantity;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder price(double price) {
            this.price = price;
            return this;
        }

        public OrdersRequest build() {
            return new OrdersRequest(this);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "OrdersRequest{" +
                "orderId='" + orderId + '\'' +
                ", customerName='" + customerName + '\'' +
                ", quantity=" + quantity +
                ", price=" + price +
                '}';
    }
}
```

### Using the Builder Pattern

With the above class, you can create an instance of `OrdersRequest` using the builder pattern like this:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OrdersRequest ordersRequest = OrdersRequest.builder()
                .orderId("12345")
                .customerName("John Doe")
                .quantity(10)
                .price(99.99)
                .build();

        System.out.println(ordersRequest);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Static `Builder` Class**:
    - The static nested `Builder` class contains the same fields as the outer class.
    - Each method in the `Builder` class sets the value of a field and returns the `Builder` object (`this`), allowing for method chaining.

2. **Private Constructor**:
    - The outer class (`OrdersRequest`) has a private constructor that takes a `Builder` object as a parameter. This constructor is used to create an instance of `OrdersRequest` using the values set in the `Builder`.

3. **`build()` Method**:
    - The `build()` method in the `Builder` class calls the private constructor of the outer class and returns the newly created object.

### Summary

The Builder pattern is a flexible and readable way to create instances of classes that require many parameters. The example provided demonstrates how to implement and use the Builder pattern in Java. The code snippet `OrdersRequest.builder().` is the starting point for building an `OrdersRequest` object, allowing you to set various properties in a fluent manner.
