Asynchronous processing refers to the execution of tasks in a non-blocking manner, where the program can continue to perform other operations while waiting for the completion of the task.

Concurrency refers to the ability of a program to handle multiple tasks at the same time. It allows for different tasks to make progress even if one of them is busy or waiting.

Multithreading is a specific type of concurrency in which different parts of a program can run concurrently and independently of each other, allowing for more efficient use of resourcesand improved performance. 
It involves creating multiple threads within a single process, each handling a different task.
