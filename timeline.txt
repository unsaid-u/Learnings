HAPPY CODING 

# Current Topic 
    * Theory -  Time complexity
    * Theory - Types of Graphs
    * Hashing
    * Code - DFS 
    * pointers in c++

# Current Data Structure - Graph 

# Current Target 
    -> learn basics of Graph - Structures and algorithms 
    -> learn language fundamentals of C++ and JAVA 
    -> Basic Coding problems on Graph - the ones listed in gfg 

Topics History (Data Structures, Algos , fundamentals etc) 
* Graphs - Started 


-> Regularly add a current topic (Theory + Code)
-> Maintain a timeline of topics * you can add as descriptively as you want 
-> Maintain a list of good coding problems * revisit them 
-> Make a habit solving few coding questions everyday, and learning a Theory topic 
    * Start with small steps - 1-2 questions , small topics etc 
-> Also learn language fundamentals of C++ and JAVA 
-> Let's start with harder topics this time - graphs, tree, DP etc..

# JAVA 
 learning Java  
    -> Basic syntax and program structure
    -> OOP 
    -> Data structures
