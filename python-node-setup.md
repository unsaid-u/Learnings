The issue arises because the Node.js package you're trying to install is using Python version 3.13, which isn't officially released, so itâ€™s likely due to a misconfiguration or an environment conflict. You can resolve this by explicitly setting your project or shell environment to use Python 3.10.16 (the version installed via Homebrew). Here's how to do it:

---

### **Steps to Use Python 3.10.16 in Your Shell**

#### 1. **Check if Python 3.10.16 is Installed Correctly**
Verify the installation:
```bash
brew info python@3.10
```
You should see the installation path, something like:
```
/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10
```

Ensure the binary is present:
```bash
ls /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin
```

#### 2. **Update Your Shell to Use Python 3.10**
Set the `PATH` to prioritize Python 3.10 binaries:
```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin:$PATH"
```

Verify the version being used:
```bash
python3 --version
```
It should now return `3.10.16`.

#### 3. **Set Python Version for Node.js**
Node.js uses Python for building certain native dependencies via `node-gyp`. You can specify the correct Python version for Node.js as follows:

##### **Globally Set Python for Node.js**
Set Python 3.10 as the default version for Node.js builds:
```bash
npm config set python /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3
```

##### **Per-Project Configuration**
If you want to set the Python version only for a specific project, use:
```bash
npx node-gyp --python /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3
```

---

#### 4. **Test the Setup**
Now, try running `npm install` in your project directory:
```bash
npm install
```

If the issue persists, clear the `node_modules` folder and reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

---

#### 5. **Optional: Persistent Shell Configuration**
To avoid resetting the `PATH` every time you open a shell, add the export line to your shell configuration file:

- **For `bash`**:
  Add this to `~/.bashrc`:
  ```bash
  export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin:$PATH"
  ```

- **For `zsh`** (default for macOS):
  Add this to `~/.zshrc`:
  ```bash
  export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin:$PATH"
  ```

Reload the shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

### **Why This Works**
- By modifying the `PATH`, you're ensuring Python 3.10 is used in your shell and is prioritized over other versions.
- By configuring `npm` to use Python 3.10 explicitly, you're ensuring Node.js native modules are built with the correct Python version.

If this still doesn't solve the problem, double-check your Node.js dependencies for hardcoded Python version requirements or conflicting configurations.

**NOTE**

Finally setting a python version in .npmrc file worked 
python=/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3.10
