## **1. Architectural Considerations**

### **a. Statelessness**
- **Description:** Design your API to be stateless, meaning each request contains all the information needed to process it, without relying on stored context on the server.
- **Benefits:** Easier to scale horizontally since any server can handle any request without sharing session data.
- **Implementation Tips:**
  - Use tokens (e.g., JWT) for authentication instead of server-side sessions.
  - Store user-specific data in client-side storage or external storage systems like Redis.

### **b. Microservices Architecture**
- **Description:** Break down your API into smaller, independent services that handle specific functionalities.
- **Benefits:** Improves scalability, maintainability, and allows independent deployment of services.
- **Implementation Tips:**
  - Identify bounded contexts and separate services accordingly.
  - Use APIs or message queues for inter-service communication.

    const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
    
    const limiter = rateLimit({
      windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
      max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
    });
    
    app.use(limiter);
    ```
  - Use API gateways (e.g., AWS API Gateway) that support built-in rate limiting.

### **c. Asynchronous Processing**

  // Check cache first
  redisClient.get(id, async (err, cachedData) => {
    if (err) throw err;

    if (cachedData) {
      return res.json(JSON.parse(cachedData));
    } else {
      // Fetch from MongoDB
      const data = await YourModel.findById(id).exec();
      if (data) {
        // Store in cache
        redisClient.setex(id, 3600, JSON.stringify(data)); // Cache for 1 hour
        return res.json(data);
      } else {
        return res.status(404).send('Data not found');
      }
    }
  });
});
```

### **c. Rate Limiting with Express.js**
```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
