The event loop is the core mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations despite being single-threaded. It's what enables JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations like handling user interactions, making API calls, and executing timers.

## How JavaScript Execution Works

JavaScript runs on a single thread, meaning it can only execute one piece of code at a time. However, it can handle multiple operations seemingly simultaneously through the event loop system.

## Key Components

**Call Stack**: Where JavaScript executes synchronous code. Functions are pushed onto the stack when called and popped off when they complete.

**Web APIs/Browser APIs**: Browser-provided features like `setTimeout`, DOM events, and HTTP requests that can run outside the main JavaScript thread.

**Callback Queue (Task Queue)**: Where callbacks from completed asynchronous operations wait to be executed.

**Microtask Queue**: A higher-priority queue for Promise callbacks and other microtasks.

## The Event Loop Process

1. JavaScript executes code from the call stack
2. When asynchronous operations (like `setTimeout`) are encountered, they're handed off to Web APIs
3. Once these operations complete, their callbacks are placed in the appropriate queue
4. The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty
5. When empty, it first processes all microtasks, then moves one task from the callback queue to the call stack

## Example in Action

```javascript
console.log('1');

setTimeout(() => console.log('2'), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('3'));

console.log('4');
```

Output: 1, 4, 3, 2

Here's why: synchronous code runs first (1, 4), then microtasks like Promises (3), then callback queue tasks like setTimeout (2).

## Why This Matters

The event loop prevents JavaScript from blocking. Without it, a long-running operation would freeze the entire application. Instead, expensive operations can be handled asynchronously, keeping the user interface responsive while background tasks complete.

This design is why JavaScript can handle thousands of concurrent connections in Node.js or manage complex user interfaces in browsers without appearing to freeze or lag.

The task queue and microtask queue handle different types of asynchronous operations, with microtasks having higher priority than tasks.

## Microtask Queue (Higher Priority)

**Promise callbacks**: `.then()`, `.catch()`, `.finally()` callbacks
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Promise'));
```

**async/await**: Code after `await` is essentially a Promise callback
```javascript
async function example() {
    await somePromise;
    console.log('After await'); // This goes to microtask queue
}
```

**queueMicrotask()**: Explicitly queues a microtask
```javascript
queueMicrotask(() => console.log('Microtask'));
```

**MutationObserver**: DOM mutation callbacks
```javascript
const observer = new MutationObserver(() => console.log('DOM changed'));
```

## Task Queue (Lower Priority)

**Timer callbacks**: `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearTimeout`, `clearInterval`
```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log('Timer'), 0);
setInterval(() => console.log('Interval'), 1000);
```

**DOM events**: Click, scroll, keypress, etc.
```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', () => console.log('Clicked'));
```

**HTTP requests**: `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest` (but their Promise parts go to microtask queue)
```javascript
// The network request itself is a task, but .then() is a microtask
fetch('/api').then(response => console.log('Response'));
```

**I/O operations**: File reading, network operations in Node.js
```javascript
// Node.js
fs.readFile('file.txt', () => console.log('File read'));
```

**MessageChannel/postMessage**: Cross-frame communication
```javascript
const channel = new MessageChannel();
channel.port2.onmessage = () => console.log('Message received');
```

**setImmediate** (Node.js only): Similar to setTimeout(0)
```javascript
setImmediate(() => console.log('Immediate'));
```

## Processing Order Example

```javascript
console.log('1'); // Synchronous

setTimeout(() => console.log('2'), 0); // Task queue

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('3')); // Microtask queue

queueMicrotask(() => console.log('4')); // Microtask queue

setTimeout(() => console.log('5'), 0); // Task queue

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log('6'); // Microtask queue
    queueMicrotask(() => console.log('7')); // New microtask
});

console.log('8'); // Synchronous
```

Output: 1, 8, 3, 4, 6, 7, 2, 5

## Key Differences

**Priority**: All microtasks are processed before any task from the task queue.

**Batch processing**: The event loop processes ALL available microtasks before moving to the next task, but only processes ONE task at a time before checking for microtasks again.

**Starvation risk**: Too many microtasks can starve the task queue, potentially blocking UI updates or other important tasks.

This priority system ensures that Promise chains and async/await operations complete quickly, while heavier operations like timers and DOM events are handled when the main thread is less busy.
